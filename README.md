# odin-landing-page

This web page is my attemp at the Landing Page project from the Flexbox module in The Odin Project's Foundations Course. This will showcase all the skills presented thus far throughout the course. This project will include concepts such as HTML layout, CSS styling, and the Flexbox tools included within CSS.

This is a generic, single page site built with the above mentioned concepts and will include free use images sourced from the web. The colors, fonts, and visual design style are perscribed per the design images included within the project's assignment guidelines.

I will write all content contained within the index.html and styles.css source files based on my own current understanding of these markup languages. No part of the final product will be copied or reproduced from pre-existing examples. I will use various teaching references that have been provided within the previous modules of The Odin Project.
